This repository contains 3 files:
* Two clients (one for RaspberyPI with camera module installed and the other for PC localhost)
* One server witch runs on PC

For any program to work correctly You may have to create directory named "zdjecia" for PC client or "shots" for RPI client for script to store images.
Additionally in server script you may want to change path to model.
